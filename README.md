# Getting Started with Create React App

This react project is based on fully runtime JSON base dynamic form. Each field is created based on JSON data with respective properties.
Instead of using backend stack, I've use `dummy JSON file` as source form config.
If backend is required, then will do so.

## Available Scripts
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Step to start project

- Download the project here.
- From the project directory run `npm install` to download all node_modules file.
- then `npm start` to start that project finally.

### I can make sure that it's a fully dynamic and JSON based form demo.
